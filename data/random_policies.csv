CCLW.document.i00000344.n0000,National Climate Agreement (Klimaatakkoord),28/06/2019,"<p>The National Climate Agreement builds on the Energy Accord, but rather than focusing solely on energy policy, it addresses all greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023 the emission reduction targets of the National Climate Agreement were further hardened through the Coalition Agreement 2021-2025. In order to achieve these targets, additional measures were introduced in “Sharp targets, sharp choices”, a report one national climate policy for 2030 and 2050, which included the following commitments:</p>
<p>The 2019 agreement set out a strategy to achieve 49% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and 95% by 2050. The new and hardened target of the National Climate Agreement contains <strong>a net zero pledge. </strong>The goal is to be climate-neutral by 2050 at the latest, and achieve a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In order to achieve the ambition for 2030 the target for policy is focused on reducing CO2 emissions by 60% in 2030. To meet this end, the government also presented an additional climate package on the 26th of April, 2023. This includes a €35 billion climate and transition fund for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the National Climate Agreement came as a response to the Urgenda case and in parallel to the Climate Act. It details agreements made with the following sectors: electricity, industry, built environment, traffic and transport, and agriculture. The Agreement also introduces a carbon tax, applicable to industry and levied against emissions that exceed the EU ETS Benchmarks (after the deduction of a predefined reduction path). The tax applies to all installations in the EU ETS, as well as waste incinerators and large emitters of non-CO2 GhGs, such as N2). The CO2 tax levy will start at €30/t CO2 in 2021 and will increase each year by €10.56, up to a rate of €125/t CO2 in 2030. The annual additional costs associated with the Climate Agreement are estimated to be less than 0.5% of GDP in 2030.</p>
<p>The National Climate Agreement contains commitments with five sectors on the measures they will take over the next 10 years and beyond to meet climate targets. The following targets are decided upon per sector:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electricity: in 2030 the Netherlands want 70% of all electricity to come from wind turbines on sea and land, and solar panels on roofs and solar parks. By 2050 the Netherlands wants to be completely free from fossil fuels, like coal and gas&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industry: by 2050 the industry is circular, and “emits virtually no more greenhouse gases”</li>
<li>Mobility: by 2050 Dutch traffic and all transport will no longer emit harmful exhaust gases and CO2</li>
<li>The built environment: by 2050, 7 million homes and 1 million buildings need to be off natural gas</li>
<li>Agriculture and land-use: by 2050, agriculture and land-use will be climate neutral&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

CCLW.document.i00000263.n0000,Electricity Act,30/06/1998,"<p>The Electricity Act (E-Act) 1998 is an important basis for the creation of the electricity market in the Netherlands. By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.<br><br>On April 9, 2018, the Energy Transition Act (wet VET) was adopted to amend the 1998 document and the Gas Act. The objective of this Act is to make the uptake of renewable energies in the country easier by reviewing extensively and in much detail the previous legal framework.<br><br>The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.<br><br>The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.<br><br>As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a ‘free category' to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).<br><br>Since its introduction in 1998 several amendments have been made to incorporate new elements such as the transposition of EU Directives. Several changes have been introduced in the E- Act in 2010, such as smart metering and congestion management rules for electricity) in order to improve the Dutch energy market.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(26,32,44);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: medium;"">Currently, a bill for a new Energy Act has been proposed to the Dutch parliament, which will be the legal foundation of the Dutch energy transition. This Act is now under discussion in the House of Representatives (Second Chamber) before it will be proposed to the Senate, who can either adopt or reject the bill. It will replace the current Gas Act and Electricity Act 1998, and provides a future-proof legislative framework for the energy transition, aimed at modernising and updating the regulative framework for electricity and gas. It also re-implements the EU Clean Energy Package (Directive 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market in electricity). </span>&nbsp;</p>

CCLW.document.i00000681.n0000,"Act on Renewable Energy Sources ('RES Act', Dz.U. 2015 poz. 478)",20/02/2015,"<ul>
<li>This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020. The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power). The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>support for max 15 years from the start of renewable energy production in the given installation;</li>
<li>support for hydropower of max 5 MW of capacity;</li>
<li>support for biomass co-firing installations of less than 150 MW capacity capped to equivalent of the average generation over 2011-2013;</li>
<li>large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 €/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called ‘prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business. The Act was amended in June 2018, alongside the 2016 Act on investments in wind power and the 1994 Construction Act, in order to boost offshore wind investment. It was further amended in August 2019 to extend the agreements on grid connection and updates the auction mechanism.<br><br>The Act was notably amended by bill 1129/2021 to extend the period for auctions of energy sales, set auction volumes, and remove obligations for small producers of renewable energy.</p>

It sets a binding Union target for the overall share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy in 2030. It also lays down rules on financial support for electricity from renewable sources, on self-consumption of such electricity, on the use of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector and in the transport sector, on regional cooperation between Member States, and between Member States and third countries, on guarantees of origin, on administrative procedures and on information and training. It also establishes sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Supplementing Regulation 2019/807 lays down the criteria for determining high indirect land-use change-risk feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high carbon stock is observed and the certification of low indirect land-use change-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels.<br><br>As part of the EU's 'Fit for 55' package, a legislative package that aims to align the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies with a GHG emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels), this Directive has been reformed to set an overall binding renewable energy target of at least 42.5% in the EU's energy mix by 2030, while aiming for a target of 45%.

<p>The Directive aims to ensure that companies active within the internal market of the European Union contribute to sustainable development and the green transition, in line with other EU regulations and directives, by establishing reporting, due diligence and transition planning requirements for companies (and their subsidiaries) and upstream suppliers within company value chains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Directive sets out the obligation for companies to adopt and implement a transition plan for climate change mitigation. The plan should aim to ensure that the company’s business model and strategy are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C, in line with the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 2 establishes which companies the Directive applies to. Article 5 sets out the due diligence actions Member States must ensure companies comply with, including the integration of due diligence into company policies and risk management systems (in accordance with Article 7), the identification and assessment of actual or potential adverse impacts (in accordance with Article 8 and Article 9, where necessary), and the prevention and mitigation of potential adverse impacts (in accordance with Articles 10 and 11).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 22 sets out the Directive’s specific provisions on combatting climate change, elaborating on the transition planning obligations established in Article 1(c). Article 22 determines that company transition plans must include time-bound targets on climate change mitigation measures for 2030 and in five-year periods up to 2050 “based on conclusive scientific evidence” and “where appropriate, absolute emissions reduction targets” for scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (Article 22.1(c) of the Directive). Transition plans must also describe the decarbonisation levers and key actions that have been identified to reach the emissions reduction targets, a quantified explanation of the investments and funding that support the implementation of the transition plan, amongst other provisions. Article 22.3 establishes that Member States must ensure that company transition plans are updated every 12 months and contain descriptions of the progress companies have made towards achieving their emissions reduction targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 36 establishes review and reporting measures on the Directive. By July 2030, the European Commission is obliged to submit a report to the European Parliament and Council on the implementation of the Directive and whether its objectives have effectively been reached. Article 36(e) states that the report must assess whether the rules on combatting climate change set out in the Directive, particularly those on the design of transition plans for climate change mitigation (and their adoption and implementation by companies), and the power of supervisory authorities relating to these rules, need to be revised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Article 37 sets out the timeline for transposing the Directive, from July 2026 onwards and for applying the transposed measures from July 2027 onwards.&nbsp;</p>
